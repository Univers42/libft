# Memory Leak Fixes Applied

## Summary
This document describes the memory leak fixes applied to the libft project.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Memory Tracker Realloc Failure (Critical)
**File:** `memory/memory_tracker.c`
**Function:** `safe_malloc()`
**Issue:** When realloc() failed during tracker expansion, the original memory was lost and the newly allocated `ptr` was leaked.
**Fix:** 
- Use a temporary variable for realloc() result
- Free the newly allocated `ptr` if realloc() fails
- Prevents memory leak on expansion failure

### 2. Error Registry strdup() Failure
**File:** `classes/trace/error/general_err_handler.c`
**Function:** `registry_add_message()`
**Issue:** strdup() result was not checked for failure, potentially causing memory inconsistency.
**Fix:**
- Check strdup() return value
- Free the allocated entry if strdup() fails
- Return error code properly

### 3. Event System Exit Without Cleanup
**File:** `classes/render/event/event_system.c`
**Function:** `handle_close()`
**Issue:** Called exit(0) directly without cleaning up allocated resources.
**Fix:**
- Call the destroy method before exit(0)
- Ensures proper cleanup of event system resources

## Testing
All fixes have been tested with:
- Manual verification of allocation/free patterns
- Build system verification (no compilation errors)
- AddressSanitizer verification (no leaks detected)
- Stress testing of memory tracker functionality

## Remaining Considerations
- The singleton in `err_default_registry()` is intentionally not freed as it follows the singleton pattern
- This is acceptable as it's a one-time allocation for the lifetime of the program

## Files Modified
1. `memory/memory_tracker.c`
2. `classes/trace/error/general_err_handler.c` 
3. `classes/render/event/event_system.c`
4. `.gitignore` (to exclude build artifacts)
